## A virtual world on the Web, with immersive audio integration

This is an experimentation of a virtual space, easily accessible through the browser, to showcase the major benefits of immersive audio in such environments. You can see it as a discovery area, and decide for yourself.

This demonstration is enabled by [the Atmoky package](https://atmoky.com/), which supports the 3D sound objects distribution & the Binaural spatialization.

## General indications

This environment is best experienced with a headset, and in full screen - as well as with a computer rather than a mobile.

## Thoughts

I started this project without any notion in JavaScript or Three.js, a few months ago. Then I picked it up again after having gained some experience, which explains why the code can be messy sometimes.

**Edit:** It's been refactored with React Three Fiber since then, and is much more optimized.

But feel free to send me messages if you have any comments, recommendations, criticisms, or just to chat!
