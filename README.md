## A virtual world on the Web, with immersive audio integration

This is an experimentation of a virtual space, easily accessible through the browser, to showcase the major benefits of immersive audio in such environments. You can see it as a discovery area, and decide for yourself.

This demonstration is enabled by [the Atmoky package](https://atmoky.com/), which supports the 3D sound objects distribution & the Binaural spatialization.

## General indications

This virtual space is accessible only through a computer, and not yet available for mobile.

**If the window is cropped, and displays most of the screen as white, try slightly resizing the page. This will refresh the window dimensions.**

This environment is best experienced with a headset, and in full screen.

## Thoughts

I started this project without any notion in JavaScript or Three.js, a few months ago. Then I picked it up again after having gained some experience.

So the code is obviously messy sometimes, I would have used React or one of its frameworks if I had started now.

But feel free to send me messages if you have any comments, recommendations, criticisms, or just to chat!
