# Metaverse

This experiment is an example of 3D Audio integration in a virtual space with Blockchain interaction, that could be described as a "Metaverse", should we concede the recent misnomer and misconception around that term.

I aim to offer an idea of how much 3D Audio could help achieve deep immersion into a virtual space, therefore illustrating the prospective value of this concept in metaverses as such.

(Soon) You can explore the research paper associated with this project (French).
